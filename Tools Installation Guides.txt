WINDOWS' GUIDE:

1. Maven Installation
To install Maven on Windows, follow these steps:

### 1. **Download Maven**:
   - Go to the official Maven website: [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
   - Download the binary zip archive (e.g., `apache-maven-3.x.x-bin.zip`).

### 2. **Extract Maven**:
   - After downloading the zip file, extract it to a directory where you want Maven to be installed (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven`).

### 3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   You need to set up environment variables so that you can use Maven from the command line.

   **Steps**:
   1. Right-click on **This PC** or **Computer** and select **Properties**.
   2. Click on **Advanced system settings**.
   3. In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
   4. Under **System Variables**, click **New** to add a new system variable:
      - **Variable name**: `MAVEN_HOME`
      - **Variable value**: The path where you extracted Maven (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.x.x`).

   5. Edit the **Path** variable:
      - In the **System Variables** section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
      - Add the Maven `bin` directory path to the `Path` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.x.x\bin`).
      - Click **OK** to save the changes.

### 4. **Verify Maven Installation**:
   1. Open a new command prompt (this ensures that the updated environment variables are loaded).
   2. Type the following command to verify Maven is installed correctly:
      ```bash
      mvn -version
      ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you should see Maven's version and other system information.

Now Maven is installed and ready to use on your Windows system!


2. Allure Installation
To install Allure on Windows, follow these steps:

    ! You need a package manager like **Scoop** or **Chocolatey** to install Allure easily. !

                                    (here I am using Scoop)

Scoop will manage the installation of the software and add it to your system path, making it easy to use from the command line.

### 1. **Install Scoop** (if not already installed):
1. **Open PowerShell**:
   - Open PowerShell with administrator privileges (right-click on the PowerShell icon and select **Run as Administrator**).

   **Run the installation command**:
   - Execute the following command to install Scoop:
     ```
     iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
     ```
   This command downloads and runs the installation script for Scoop.

### **Verify Scoop Installation**:
   Once the installation is complete, verify that Scoop is installed by typing:
   ```
   scoop --version
   ```
This should display the version of Scoop, confirming that it has been installed successfully.


Allure Installation with Scoop:

If the **Scoop** already installed:
1. Open PowerShell (or Command Prompt).
2. Run the following command to install Allure:
   ```
   scoop install allure
   ```

### 2. **Verify Allure Installation**:
After installing Allure, you can verify it by running the following command in a new command prompt:
```
allure --version
```
You should see the installed version of Allure displayed.

MAC OS'S GUIDE:

1. Maven Installation
To install Maven on macOS, you can follow one of these methods:
      1. **Homebrew** (recommended), 
      2. **Manual Installation**, or 
      3. using a **package manager**.

### Method 1: Install Maven via Homebrew (Recommended)

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   - If you donâ€™t have Homebrew, you can install it by running this command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Install Maven using Homebrew**:
   - Once Homebrew is installed, simply run:
     ```bash
     brew install maven
     ```

3. **Verify Maven installation**:
   - After installation, verify that Maven is installed correctly by running:
     ```bash
     mvn -version
     ```

   This command should display the Maven version, Java version, and other system information.

That's it! Maven should now be installed and configured on your macOS.


2. Allure Installation
To install Allure on macOS, you can use **Homebrew** (recommended) or **manual installation**. Here are the steps for both methods:

### Method 1: Install Allure via Homebrew (Recommended)

     ```bash
     unzip allure-2.x.x.zip -d /usr/local/allure
     ```

3. **Add Allure to the system PATH**:
   - To use Allure from the terminal, you need to add its `bin` directory to your system's `PATH`.
   - Open your terminal and edit your shell configuration file (`.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`) using a text editor:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bash_profile if you're using bash
     ```

   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/allure/bin
     ```

4. **Apply the changes**:
   - After adding the line, save the file and reload the profile by running:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

5. **Verify the installation**:
   - Run the following command to check if Allure is installed properly:
     ```bash
     allure --version
     ```
